  {
    id: 1,
    category: "Queue & Traversal",
    question: "Which data structure is fundamentally used by Breadth First Search (BFS) to maintain level-by-level order?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "Queue (First-In, First-Out)", correct: true },
      { id: "B", text: "Stack (Last-In, First-Out)", correct: false },
      { id: "C", text: "Priority Queue without weights", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "Binary Search Tree", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "BFS relies on a standard FIFO Queue so that nodes discovered earlier (at lower levels) are explored before nodes discovered later."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    category: "Shortest Path",
    question: "Why does BFS guarantee the shortest path in an unweighted graph?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "Because it sorts the edge weights dynamically.", correct: false },
      { id: "B", text: "Because it explores all nodes at distance k before exploring distance k+1.", correct: true },
      { id: "C", text: "Because it backtracks when it encounters a dead end.", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "Because it visits leaf nodes first.", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "BFS expands in concentric rings: all distance 1 nodes are explored before distance 2 nodes, ensuring the first time the target is found is via the minimum number of hops."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: "Visited Set & Cycles",
    question: "What happens if you run BFS on a graph with cycles without maintaining a 'visited' set?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "The algorithm automatically skips the cycles.", correct: false },
      { id: "B", text: "The graph turns into a binary tree.", correct: false },
      { id: "C", text: "An infinite loop occurs because nodes are repeatedly added back to the queue.", correct: true },
      { id: "D", text: "The time complexity improves to O(V).", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "Without marking nodes as visited/discovered, adjacent nodes in a cycle will continuously re-enqueue each other forever."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: "Complexity Analysis",
    question: "What is the time complexity of BFS on a graph with V vertices and E edges using an adjacency list?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "O(V * E)", correct: false },
      { id: "B", text: "O(V + E)", correct: true },
      { id: "C", text: "O(V^2)", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "O(log V)", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "Each vertex is enqueued and dequeued at most once (O(V)), and every edge is traversed/checked once (O(E)), yielding O(V + E)."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    category: "BFS vs DFS",
    question: "If we replace the Queue in BFS with a Stack (LIFO), what traversal algorithm do we get?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "Depth First Search (DFS)", correct: true },
      { id: "B", text: "Dijkstra's Algorithm", correct: false },
      { id: "C", text: "A* Search", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "Kruskal's Algorithm", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "A Stack processes the most recently discovered node first (Last-In, First-Out), which drives the search deep along a branch before backtracking — exactly DFS."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    category: "Queue Cycle",
    question: "In the 3-step BFS loop, what is the exact order of operations?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "Enqueue neighbors ➔ Explore ➔ Dequeue front", correct: false },
      { id: "B", text: "Dequeue front ➔ Explore connected edges ➔ Enqueue unvisited neighbors", correct: true },
      { id: "C", text: "Explore all nodes ➔ Dequeue everything ➔ Mark root visited", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "Dequeue front ➔ Clear visited set ➔ Repeat", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "The standard BFS cycle: 1. Dequeue front node from queue, 2. Explore its neighbors, 3. Enqueue any neighbor that is not yet visited."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    category: "Levels & Distance",
    question: "If Start Node A is at Level 0, and has neighbors B and C, and B connects to D, what is the BFS Level of D?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "Level 1", correct: false },
      { id: "B", text: "Level 2", correct: true },
      { id: "C", text: "Level 3", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "Level 0", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "A is at Level 0. Neighbors B and C are at Level 1. D is a neighbor of B, so Level(D) = Level(B) + 1 = 1 + 1 = Level 2."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    category: "Debugging BFS",
    question: "A student's BFS traversal order is [A, B, D, C, E] on a graph where A connects to (B, C), and B connects to D. What is the bug?",
    options: [
      { id: "A", text: "Node D (Level 2) was visited before finishing Level 1 (Node C) — this is DFS, not BFS.", correct: true },
      { id: "B", text: "Node A should have been visited last.", correct: false },
      { id: "C", text: "Node E cannot be reached in BFS.", correct: false },
      { id: "D", text: "There is no bug, BFS allows any random order.", correct: false }
    ],
    explanation: "BFS strictly explores horizontally layer-by-layer. All nodes at Level 1 (both B and C) MUST be dequeued and explored before any node at Level 2 (D) is explored."
